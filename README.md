# Showdown! Battle History Tracker
By smelin27

![Animated Ferrothorn sprite](/src/images/ferrothorn.gif)

An automated Pokémon Showdown battle history tracker, for displaying your results in each format against opponents.  
When you battle someone, click the Ferrothorn icon in your address bar to see your history against them, with a total wins/losses count then separated by format.  
Currently in beta stage with barebones features. More coming Soon™.

Now published as an extension!  
Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/showdownbattlehistorytracker/  
Chrome/Edge: Coming soon!

Bug reports are very appreciated. At the moment, the extension *will* break if you're in multiple active battles at a time, counting wins incorrectly. I might fix it eventually but it would require a significant redesign, and I don't think being in multiple battles is that common anyway.

I don't have a snappy name or icon yet. Suggestions welcome.
