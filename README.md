An automated Pokémon Showdown battle history tracker, for displaying your results in each format against opponents.

Not yet published as an extension, but coming soon™! Firefox first, because it's what I use, then Chrome soon after. Maybe Opera or Edge if you're lucky. No promises.

I don't have a snappy name or icon yet. Suggestions welcome.
